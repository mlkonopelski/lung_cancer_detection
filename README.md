# Solve Lung Cancer Detection Challange

![alt text](resources/example_detection.png "Example")


Personal TODO list for this project [unsorted]:
[x] Retrain SegmentationApp to Save a model for LunaApp. Add little Augmentations. EPOCHS: 30 GPU
[ ] Build more automatic/torch way of Augmentations instead of manual transformations
[ ] Apply elastic deformations, where we put “digital crumples” into the inputs [http://mng.bz/Md5Q]
[ ] Apply Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Consistency Training https://arxiv.org/abs/ 1904.12848
